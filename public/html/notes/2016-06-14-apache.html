<p>The first <em>RewriteCond</em> allows requests for files which already exists,<br />
The second <em>RewriteCond</em> allowed requests for directories which already exists,<br />
The third <em>RewriteCond</em> makes sure to not redirect any of the <em>data</em>, <em>html</em>, <em>css</em> or <em>js</em> directories</p>
<p>The first <em>RewriteRule</em> says that if any of the <em>RewriteCond</em> matched, we do not do anything else<br />
(i.e. return from this function)<br />
The second <em>RewriteRule</em> says that if we have not returned from the previous <em>RewriteRule</em> we will return index.html<br />
instead of what was requested (which makes html5mode work)</p>

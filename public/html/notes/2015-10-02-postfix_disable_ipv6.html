<pre><code>Starting Postfix Mail Transport Agent: postfixpostmulti: warning:
inet_protocols: disabling IPv6 name/address support: Address family not supported by protocol
postmulti: warning: inet_protocols: disabling IPv6 name/address support: Address family not supported by protocol
postfix: warning: inet_protocols: disabling IPv6 name/address support: Address family not supported by protocol</code></pre>
<h2 id="solution">Solution:</h2>
<pre><code>sudo postconf -e &#39;inet_protocols = ipv4&#39;
sudo /etc/init.d/postfix restart</code></pre>

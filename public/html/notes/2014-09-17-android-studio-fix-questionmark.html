<p>If you get questionmarks instead of phone name when trying to run your app, you<br />
can fix it with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env bash
path=&quot;/opt/android-studio&quot;  # Path where Android Studio is installed
set -e

&quot;$path/sdk/platform-tools/adb&quot; kill-server
sudo &quot;$path/sdk/platform-tools/adb&quot; start-server
&quot;$path/sdk/platform-tools/adb&quot; devices</code></pre>
<p>If it doesn't work the first time, try a few more times</p>

<p>If you has a rsa-key and don't want to write in your credentials every time you ssh, you can use ssh-agent instead.<br />
Add this to your .bash_profile (or make it a standalone script you execute once at startup)</p>
<pre><code>SSHAGENT=$(command -v ssh-agent)
SSHAGENTARGS=&quot;-s&quot;
if ! pgrep -xu $USER ssh-agent &amp;&gt;/dev/null; then
  if [[ -z &quot;$SSH_AUTH_SOCK&quot; &amp;&amp; -x &quot;$SSHAGENT&quot; ]]; then
    eval &quot;$($SSHAGENT $SSHAGENTARGS)&quot;
    trap &quot;kill $SSH_AGENT_PID&quot; 0
  fi
fi</code></pre>
<p>Then you add you credentials once by typing ssh-add (which will add ~/.ssh/id_rsa, you can also add others) and write in your password. Now ssh-agent will automatically provide the password for you for the duration of the session.</p>
